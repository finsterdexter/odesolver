An Ordinary Differential Equation Solver in Go
===================

The objective of this library is to accept a set of independent values (such as a time t) and a function that encapsulates an ODE, then output the iterative results for the ODE using [Runge-Kutta](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge%E2%80%93Kutta_methods). I eventually plan to implement a user-defined lambda and start and final values for the independent value, instead of an array of values.
